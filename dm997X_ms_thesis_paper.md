## THESIS PAPER GUIDELINES

For standard formatting, consult
Master's Thesis and Project Guidelines_March2014 version.pdf

Please take care when reviewing the information provided by Beth when completing your Theses, especially to bring 3 copies of the signature pages on acid-free paper (what you will print the final Thesis on) to the Defense for signing. 

Please also note there are two pages which have signatures:
The first is seen in the Thesis guidelines, and contains spacing for:
The Project Advisor   
Department Head

The second signature page is not in the guidelines. This page is dedicated to the Defense Panel, and should include spacing for:
The Project Advisor
Co-Director
External Reviewer

1. Eric needs a copy each for Luke and DeAngela—so two copies for the department.
Then you need to get one to your advisor and one to your external.
Thats 4 copies of UNBOUND thesis.
(You can put each in a plastic folder from Staples)

2. Bound copies—once the thesis is approved—you will have to bind 3 copies.  It takes a minimum of 5 days to bind.
If you want a bound copy for yourself—that’s a 4th copy—otherwise, just bind 3.
The place to bind it is on the pdf I gave you—the one that Nina re-distributed for us last Friday Dec 5.

3. There needs to be 3 signatures, preferably with the person’s title on the thesis.  Advisor, External Advisor, Department Co-Chair (please use DeAngela’s title).
Please look up the titles of your thesis people.  Bring 3 copies of this page SEPARATELY to your thesis defense committee review.
ie. Drew Elliott, Chief Creative Officer, Paper Communications
ie. Jody Culkin, Artist, Professor at CUNY’s Borough of Manhattan Community College in the Media Arts and Technology Department
ie  De Angela L. Duff ,Co-Director / Industry Associate Professor, Integrated Digital Media / NYU School of Engineering
ie. R. Luke Dubois, DMA, 
CO-DIRECTOR / ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF INTEGRATED DIGITAL MEDIA, NYU SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING

Regarding the printed copies for De Angela and Luke. Please send me a copy of your Thesis electronically (a PDF would be ideal). You do not need to worry about printing these 2 copies; however, if you have already printed these out, please feel free to submit them to me and I can distribute. 

As this is an alteration to the original directions, I would like to recap:
2 printed copies to be delivered to your project advisor and your external
A digital copy sent to me for forwarding to Luke and De Angela
If you have printed these copies already, please feel free to bring them to me for distribution.

***I would also like to mention that our final presentations, including Thesis Defenses, may be recorded for documentation on the IDM Show's website. If you are not comfortable with possibly having your Defense documented, please let me know as soon as possible.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask!
