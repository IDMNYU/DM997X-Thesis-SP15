## THESIS PAPER GUIDELINES

For standard formatting, consult
Master's Thesis and Project Guidelines_March2014 version.pdf, the word templates, as well as [Succeeding with your master's dissertation a step-by-step handbook] (https://getit.library.nyu.edu/go/6809674) by John Biggam (available for download via Bobst's ebrary)

### Assignment: The “elevator pitch” / Thesis Statement
Read [Indiana University's How To Write a Thesis Statement] (http://www.indiana.edu/~wts/pamphlets/thesis_statement.shtml) BEFORE you write your thesis statement.

First, ask yourself what question is your research trying to answer? Please read the above link.

Secondly, tun that question into a statement.

Here's a guide for a starting point. 

** *(Working Title)* is a *(What is it?)* that *(What does it do?)* for *(Your Audience)* to *(Why? What's the purpose)*.** 

*Note: Obviously you would not leave the parenthesis, it's a just a marker to denote what you should add.*

Do not use **I** in your thesis statement.

### Assignment: Visual Outline or Mind Map
Read [Columbia University's Skimming vs. Reading] (http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~martins/sen_sem/thesis_org.html#Skimming) and [Columbia University's Order of Writing] (http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~martins/sen_sem/thesis_org.html#Order) at http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~martins/sen_sem/thesis_org.html BEFORE creating your visual outline. Use the figures, graphs, and illustrations you will use in your paper. This visual outline will also be extremely helpful in your project presentations and (mock) thesis defenses. 

Or

Look at the example of a mind map on basecamp, and create a mind map of your paper.

### Assignment: Written Outline
Read [Indiana University's Using Outlines] (http://www.indiana.edu/~wts/pamphlets/outlines.shtml), BEFORE you write your outline.

Review [Indiana University's Using Outlines] (http://www.indiana.edu/~wts/pamphlets/outlines.shtml), BEFORE you write your detailed outline.

### Assignment: Body 

I recommend you use some sort of version control for keeping track of drafts of your writing. 
* I'd highly recommend writing your paper using **github** (the best version control out there.)
* Secondly, I'd recommend **google drive** (where you can roll back to different versions)
* Worst case scenario, would be creating **manual version control by duplicating your word processing (MS Word, Pages, etc.) file and adding the date to each major draft**.

BEFORE you write your body, read:
* [Indiana University's Paragraphs and Topic Sentences] (http://www.indiana.edu/~wts/pamphlets/paragraphs.shtml)
* Chapter 5, The Literature Review, in [Succeeding with your master's dissertation a step-by-step handbook] (https://getit.library.nyu.edu/go/6809674) by John Biggam (available for download via Bobst's ebrary)
* Chapter 7, Research Methods, in [Succeeding with your master's dissertation a step-by-step handbook] (https://getit.library.nyu.edu/go/6809674) by John Biggam (available for download via Bobst's ebrary)

*I recommend the following chapters. However, you can change the nomenclature or add or subtract to these as you see fit.*

 * **Research**
    * *Literature Review:* Who-is-writing-what in relation to your research area(s).
    * *Related Work or Competitive Analysis:* Who-is-doing-what in relation to your research area(s). Conduct a comparative analysis of similar projects. Who or what are your competitors? How will it be positioned (branding) and differentiated (market and competitors or like works)? 
    * *Research:* Including, but not limited to, brainstorming (thought maps, word lists, etc.), readings, screenings / viewings, investigation of other artists, designers, or entrepreneur’s work, tech research, material research, visual research, collection, interviews, observation, etc.
        * You should decide what kinds of research / reference / inspiration is most appropriate for your project. 
    * *Research Methods:* Information about your research strategy, data collection techniques, how you intend to analyze your collected data and limitations of your research. 

* **Design** (including, but not limited to)
    * design sketches, process maps, drawings, wireframes / schematics, storyboards, comps, mood boards, concept boards, screen shots, videos, diagrams, images 
        <ul>
        <li>You should decide which processes are most appropriate for your project.</li>
        </ul>

* **Resources** (including, but not limited to)
    * List of Collaborators, Participants, and Advisors (People and their roles). Be Specific. First &amp; Last Names and URLs if available
    * Materials &amp; Vendors List
    * Technical requirements
    * Budget
  You should decide what kinds of resources are most appropriate for your project. (How are you achieving this?)

* **Development**
    * Prototype(s) – including, but not limited to, exercises, tests, models, maquettes, animatics 
        <ul>
        <li>A prototype “is an early sample or model built to test a concept or process or to act as a thing to be replicated or learned from.”</li>
        <li>As a result, a prototype can take on many forms. Essentially, it is your project or aspects of your project in an unfinished form.</li>
        <li>You should decide what kinds of prototype(s) are most appropriate for your project.</li>
        </ul>
     * Alpha
     * Beta
     * Gold

* **User Testing**
    * Results: Information about the data you collected at each stage of development and how it compares against your Literature Review, Related Work, or Competitive Analysis findings.
