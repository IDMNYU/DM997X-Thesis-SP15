## Welcome to MS Thesis In Digital Media!

This is the second semester of a two-semester sequence culminating in a thesis defense, a thesis paper, a thesis project, and  thesis website, accomplished through a combination of questioning, researching, building/making, writing, and researching.


### PROGRAM GOALS

The following IDM program goals are reinforced within this course. At a graduate level, students will:

* develop **conceptual thinking skills** to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
  * Students will develop a research and studio practice through inquiry and iteration.
* develop **technical skills** to realize their ideas.
  * Students will understand and utilize tools and technology, while adapting to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn.
  * Students will be able to integrate/interface different technologies within a technological ecosystem.
* develop **critical thinking skills** that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
* gain knowledge of **professional practices and organizations** by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking, and career preparation.


### COURSE GOALS

This course will help students deeply:
* question
* research
* build/make
* write
* present


### LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of the course, students will be able to develop, complete, and document a thesis that is meaningful and carefully crafted to be used for professional purposes (employment, gallery shows, funding, starting a business, etc.).


### COURSE STRUCTURE

Students are expected to be on time for all meetings, critiques, and presentations. 

This class will consist of
* Lecture
* Group Discussion
* Individual Meetings
* Project Presentations and Critique
* Mock Thesis Defenses and Critique
* Thesis Defense 

**Individual Meetings**<br>The order of our weekly, individual 10 minute status meetings will be determined on the first day of class. Individual meetings will be held after the group critiques. Students who do the group critique will NOT meet for individual meetings on the same day. Be prepared to present and discuss your work at your appointed time. Students should plan ahead and ensure that technical requirements necessary for the review of work are addressed *prior* to meeting with the instructor. 
Individual meetings are not optional. They are important and useful. Sometimes
they are most useful exactly when you feel you have nothing to talk about or show. It is normal that you may sometimes have nothing "good" to show, or even nothing at all. It is still important that you keep your appointment so that we can talk about that. If for some unusual reason you cannot make your appointment one week, please show professional courtesy and let me know ahead of time.

Discuss group A & B

self-assessment rubric

* In-class peer critiques

**Project Presentations & Mock Thesis Defenses**<br>Project critiques or mock thesis defenses will be held on designated Mondays, and will consist of the professor, ALL thesis students, and outside critics, at times. 

     Each presentation will consist of 
     * 10 to 15 minutes of presentation and 
     * 10 to 15 minutes of critique 
     (or a combination thereof)
     for 30 minutes total. 

You are always welcome to invite an outside critic to your project critiques and/or mock thesis defenses. “Outside” might mean a faculty member from IDM, another NYU college, or another university altogether, a mentor from the professional world, an expert in your area of research, etc.  

Critiques (AKA crits) are the best way to articulate your ideas to others and get immediate feedback. During the crit, the professor and your classmates analyze and suggest ways to increase the visual and conceptual impact of each existing idea. Have at least one classmate take notes for you when your work is being critiqued and do not edit the responses, whether you agree with them or not. Review your crit notes and reflect upon what was said. Ask yourself how you could combine, transform, or expand the ideas that show the most promise. However, resist the temptation to incorporate all suggestions and comments. Only utilize the ones that work for you and your project. 

Rules of the Critique:
* Be Present and Engaged (i.e. Close your laptops and stow your cellphones)
* Give Feedback to your classmates
* Do NOT take feedback personally.

Students will also conduct self assessments as well as be evaluated by the professor during or after midterm and at the end of the semester. Any action without reflection is meaningless. Real learning only occurs as part of a reflective process. Reflection is studying your own practice as seriously as you study anything. It involves thinking about why, what, and how you create something. 


### THESIS COMPONENTS
The MS Thesis in Digital Media is comprised of four primary components: 
* Thesis Paper
* Thesis Project
* Thesis Website 
* Thesis Defense


### THESIS ROLES
Your thesis is under the guidance of faculty and a community of peers, both inside and outside the university, who play a number of roles:

#### Thesis Faculty
The Thesis faculty is the primary critic and mentor throughout the thesis process. 

####Project Advisor
You will meet with your Project Advisor at least 2 to 4 times throughout the semester for feedback on your thesis paper, project, and defense presentation. *Document* your meetings with your advisor (date, time, length, and typed notes) on your thesis website.

####External Reviewer
The External Reviewer is identified in consultation with your Thesis Advisor. The Thesis Faculty or IDM's Academic Advisor will contact the External Reviewer to determine their availability for the Thesis Defense. The External Reviewer attends your Thesis Defense Panel, and will be given a digital copy of your Thesis paper for review.

####Thesis Peers
Your fellow graduate students are considered to be peers in the discussion and dialogue of your thesis. Students are strongly encouraged to share research and resources as well as critique from their peers. Utilize the grad studio MAGNET 805 to hold informal critiques and discussion.


### COMMUNICATING WITH THE PROFESSOR OUTSIDE OF CLASS

* Email contact about logistics (when, where, how many?) ONLY
* Talk to me in person directly after class, during your status meeting, or set up an appointment about issues and problems. DO NOT email long conversations. (If your email turns into paragraphs that means you should be talking to me in person not emailing me.)


### STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES

* Schedule your time (keep a calendar of some sort) 
* Come to class on time. 
* Participate in class. Be vocal.
* Present your work. 
* Meet, individually, with the professor during your scheduled time to discuss your thesis progress.
* Consult basecamp at least once a week for up to date info
* Maintain a weekly, dedicated, thesis website 
* Complete all deliverables by their due dates
* Acquire and read copies of the required books
* Action – do your absolute best
* Strive for continuous improvement
* Pay attention to detail & craft
* Take risks & be fearless in your projects
* Have fun!


### STUDENT VALUES

* Commitment
* Patience
* Focus
* Daily Discipline
* Persistence


### EVALUATION & GRADING

##### Attendance

* Attendance is mandatory during project critiques, individual status meetings, and every student’s end of semester public presentations. If you miss an individual status meeting, it is your responsibility to reschedule with the professor. 
* Unexcused absences will affect your grade. One absence is allowed; after that, your final, overall, numerical grade will drop by 5 percent (1/2 a grade point (e.g. A to an A-)) for each additional absence.
* Be on Time. Tardiness will affect your grade. For every 15 minutes of tardiness, your final, numerical grade will drop by 0.625 percent
* Contact the professor IN ADVANCE if you will not be in class (in person or by email is preferred).

#### Your final grade will be based on a synthesis of quantitative & qualitative rubrics:

##### Quantitative Grading Overview

* 50% Thesis Defense (which includes Thesis Paper and Thesis Project)
* 15% Weekly Progress: personal kanban (project milestones), calendar, self assessment rubric & [thesis website] (dm997X_ms_thesis_thesis_website.md)
* 10% Mock Thesis Defenses
* 10% Project Critique Presentations
* 2.5% Letter to Next Cohort
* 7.5% Resume, Cover Letter, LinkedIn Profile

Extra Credit: Career Counseling Appt. through NYU's Waserman Center

##### Qualitative Grading Overview

You will be judged on the quality, relevance, iteration, completion, and presentation of your thesis. 

###### A. Excellent (90-100)
The performance and attendance of the student has been of the highest level, showing sustained excellence in meeting course responsibilities. The work clearly differentiates itself from other work. The work has memorable impact, and pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond original goals. The ideas behind the work are original, thoughtful and/or imaginative. Spelling, punctuation or grammatical errors are non-existent. The work demonstrates the student’s ability to think critically and work independently. The work also demonstrates the student’s use of strong methods and process.

###### B. Very Good / Good (80-89)
The performance and attendance of the student has been good, though not of the highest level. The work is better than average and shows extra effort. The impact of the work is good, and demonstrates the utilization of the iterative process. The work employs above average craft and attention to detail.

###### C. Satisfactory (70-79)
The performance and attendance of the student has been adequate, satisfactorily meeting the course requirements. Average and competent, the work has acceptable levels of impact and conceptual development. The content of the work is sufficiently developed, but it lacks thoughtful, original, and imaginative resolution and/or attention to detail and craft. The work employs process, but does not demonstrate notable solutions.

###### D. Poor; Below Average (60-69)
The performance and attendance of the student has been less than adequate. The work is lacking in many or most areas that show any understanding of the research, design, and/or prototyping phase(s). The impact of the work is weak with unsound, unoriginal, or unimaginative thinking. Problems may include lack of interest, procrastination, poor planning and/or poor craft.

###### F. Unacceptable (59 & Below)
The performance & attendance of the student has not met course requirements. The work shows no overall understanding of the research, design, and/or prototyping phase(s) on many levels or either a severe lack of interest.


### TECHNOLOGY USE IN THE CLASSROOM

Laptop computers and other mobile devices are invaluable tools for students when used responsibly. However, this technology can also be incredibly distracting in the classroom. When in class, you may use your laptops and other devices for any activities pertaining to the course: taking notes, researching material relevant to our readings and discussions, making class presentations, etc. However, the following uses are unacceptable: checking email, instant messaging, texting, using social networking sites such as facebook, myspace, etc. **When your classmates are presenting, please close your laptops.**


### ACADEMIC HONESTY

All work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must re-do the assignment for a grade no higher than a D. In fact, a D is the highest possible course grade for any student who commits plagiarism. Please use the MLA style for citing and documenting source material.   


### ACADEMIC ACCOMMODATIONS

### ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDED TIME MANAGEMENT & PRODUCTIVITY RESOURCES BEYOND PERSONAL KANBAN

Hope these resources help. They've helped me, but the secret is discipline, focus, and prioritizing (which requires not doing something else). No system is a magic cure. A system only works if you use it daily.
