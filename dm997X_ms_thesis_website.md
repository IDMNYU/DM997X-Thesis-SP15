## THESIS WEBSITE

You should have a **dedicated**, thesis website to document the **weekly** progress of your MS Thesis in wordpress on http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu
* Students are expected to share their progress with the instructor and class using
their thesis website.
* You can receive web space from IDM’s Technology Manager, Elton Kwok, MAGNET 883. Email eltonkwok@nyu.edu to set up an appointment for your web space.
* IDM’s FTP server info: http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu (Use active mode to connect)
* Create a *thesis* folder
* Install wordpress in this folder
* Make and appointment with Elton to connect a database to this particular wordpress installation

Spencer Hargiss’ thesis website is a good example, http://www.spencerhargiss.com/thesis/. Please use Spencer’s thesis website as a guide. Why?  
* You can clearly read what his thesis was about due to his about link. You don’t have to wade through to the beginning of his posts to find this out. His navigation stands out due to its visual hierarchy.
* He explicitly stated what he did, concisely and clearly.
* He had visual documentation (images and screenshots). 
* However, most importantly, he had supporting text for these images and screenshots.

Also the following PDFs contain excellent examples of possible entries:
* http://issuu.com/russmaschmeyer/docs/motiv-process-book (process)
  * http://musicwithmotiv.com (project)
* http://www.clickcolleen.com/foodforthought/CMiller_processbook.pdf

**What your thesis website should contain?**
* *Weekly Thesis Progress*
  * at least, 1 post per week DUE at noon on Mondays. If it is not posted by noon, you will not receive credit. 
  * The majority of the posts should be your own writing (well-composed and proofread for impeccable spelling and grammar).
  * Project Advisor Meeting Documentation (2-4x)
  * Milestones / Tasks that have been completed (transcribed from your personal kanban)
  * Include who or what was involved.
  * Include images, illustrations, audio, video, snippets of research, ANNOTATED links, etc. relevant to your thesis. 
  * If you do not do anything for the week, write **I did not work on my thesis this week.**

* *An About Page*
  * The “elevator pitch” / Thesis Statement
  * A link to your pre-thesis site
  * A link to a pdf of your pre-thesis defense presentation
  * Documentation of your prototype from pre-thesis

* *Sourced & Annotated Research / Reference / Inspiration* 
  * Sourced means where did you get this from? if it is a website, provide a link. If it is a book, provide a bibliography. If it is an image, where did you get it from? If it is a quote, who said it or who did you poll or interview?
  * Annotated means with notes. You don’t have to write a novel. 1 to 2 thoughtful, contextual sentences is more than enough. So, “This was inspirational,” would not be a good note as it provides no context for your thesis. However, “This book discusses how nostalgia is a useless emotion because nostalgia is based on the past. This point of view is antithetical to my thesis because I’m trying to demonstrate how the sentimentality of nostalgia is valuable to the human experience.” is a viable note.)


**What your thesis should NOT contain?**
* How you are feeling about your MS thesis? This is different than evaluating or reflecting about what is working and what is not working. In other words, don’t rant, complain, blame, self-deprecate or make excuses on your thesis website. 
* This is a public representation of you as an artist, designer, creative technologist and/or entrepreneur. You want it to be as professional as possible. You want prospective employers, gallery owners, venture capitalists, and/or possible collaborators to take you seriously.
* Any content that is NOT related to your thesis explicitly.
