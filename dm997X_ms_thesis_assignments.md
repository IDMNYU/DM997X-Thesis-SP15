## END OF SEMESTER DELIVERABLES

### EXIT INTERVIEW
Please fill out by Monday, May 18th. http://goo.gl/forms/YHLIWeYKbI


### DELIVERABLES FOR MS THESIS PROMOTION & ARCHIVE 
You need to create a dropbox account if you have not already done so. Let me know if you do not have a dropbox account. Both you and I can get additional space if I invite you.

Each student will provide their own **dropbox link**. A dropbox link is actually different than sharing an actual *dropbox folder*. Here’s a how to: https://www.dropbox.com/help/167 (There is also a video explaining how to do it later in the page as well.) 
 
Create a dropbox link of 
* **deliverables for the ms thesis promotion &amp; archive**
  * Title of your project
  * URL to your project website
  * *at least* 3, hi-res images of your project (RAW preferably or 300dpi)
  * (OPTIONAL) quicktime video (for those of you doing video projects or projects that can be documented with video)
  * Abstract (including thesis statement)


### THESIS DEFENSE PRESENTATION
* Export as a pdf and post on basecamp 

### LETTER TO NEXT COHORT   

* Please name your file as yourname_lettertonextcohort_msthesis.pdf
* Email your letter *as a pdf* to deangela.duff@nyu.edu 

Write a letter to the next class giving them advice on how to succeed with their thesis paper, project, and defense. (What would you do differently if you could start the course again? What would you do the same?)

### PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

*NOTE: This is different than your <a href="dm4003_thesis_website.md">Thesis Process Website</a>.*

* Post URL on basecamp

This website should market and promote your body of work for possible employment or other post graduation opportunities. This should NOT be hosted on http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu. Ideally, you should have your own domain name.
