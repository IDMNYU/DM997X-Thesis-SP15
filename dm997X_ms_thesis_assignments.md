### MS THESIS BEGINNING OF SEMESTER STATUS DOC

### DELIVERABLES FOR MS THESIS CATALOG / SUPPORTING FILES 
You need to create a dropbox account if you have not already done so. Let me know if you do not have a dropbox account. Both you and I can get additional space if I invite you.

Each student will provide their own **dropbox link**. A dropbox link is actually different than sharing an actual *dropbox folder*. Here’s a how to: https://www.dropbox.com/help/167 (There is also a video explaining how to do it later in the page as well.) 
 
Create a dropbox link with the following contents:
* **deliverables for the ms thesis catalog**
  * Title of your project
  * URL to your project website
  * Hi-res images of your project (300dpi)
  * Abstract
* **all related project files** (e.g. video, HTML files, audio files, etc ) for
  * alpha
  * beta
  * gold

Here are examples of some very good, project websites:

### PORTFOLIO WEBSITE
*NOTE: This is different than your <a href="dm4003_thesis_website.md">Thesis Website</a>.*
This website should market and promote your body of work for possible employment or other post graduation opportunities. This should NOT be hosted on http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu. Ideall, you should have your own domain name.


#### LETTER TO NEXT COHORT   

Write a letter to the next class giving them advice on how to succeed with their thesis paper, project, and defense. (What would you do differently if you could start the course again? What would you do the same?)
