## THESIS PROJECT

### Assignment: Project Milestones
Break down your milestones into actionable tasks using <a href="http://personalkanban.com" target="_blank">Personal Kanban</a>. All actionable tasks should start with a verb (i.e. write, call, email, build, collect, etc.).

    Alpha, Beta, and Gold refer to a project’s life cycle. The specific parameters and expectations of each version will be individually determined in consultation with the professor.

<ul>
<li>I recommend using post-its so you can move them around
OR</li>
<li>a digital representation of your milestones using <a href="http://kanbanery.com" target="_blank">kanbanery.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
