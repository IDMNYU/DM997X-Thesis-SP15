Your thesis defenses may be recorded for documentation for IDM's websites. If you are not comfortable with possibly having your defense documented, please let IDM's Academic Advisor, Eric Maiello, know as soon as possible.

a PDF of your thesis paper.

## AT THE THESIS DEFENSE
Bring *3 copies of the signature pages on acid-free paper* (what you will print the final Thesis on) to the Defense for signing. Please note that there are two different signature pages:
The first is seen in the Thesis guidelines, and contains spacing for:
* Project Advisor (will sign at the end of the thesis defense) 
* Department Head, Jonathan Soffer (IDM's Academic Advisor, Eric Maiello, will get the department head's signature once you give him the bound copies)

The second signature page is not in the guidelines. This page is dedicated to the Defense Panel, and should include spacing for:
* Project Advisor
* Co-Director
* External Reviewer

Consult the word template, MS_Thesis_Paper_Preliminaries.doc, for both signature pages on basecamp under Files for formatting.


## AFTER THE THESIS DEFENSE

If your thesis is approved, you will have to bind 3 copies. If you want a bound copy for yourself, bind 4. It takes a minimum of 5 days to bind. The place to bind it is within the pdf, Masters_Thesis_Project_Guidelines_March2014_version.pdf, on basecamp under Files.
